    <div id="what">
        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>See how we analyzed the huge data of more than 4000 exoplanets discovered till date. 
            Our results - all the patterns, trends and relations we found withing the data that 
            we can relate to real life concepts and understand the different planetary systems and properties.</p>

        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>An interactive and interesting way to understand discover the various properties and relations 
            between exoplanetary systems in action. Use our interactive UI to change properties of planetary 
            systems and see what happens to the system in 3D as well.</p>
